Some identifiers may fall into multiple categories due to common usage. \n\nWhere the system is known, a type is unnecessary because the type is always part of the system definition. However systems often need to handle identifiers where the system is not known. There is not a 1:1 relationship between type and system, since many different systems have the same type.","requirements":"Allows users to make use of identifiers when the identifier system is not known.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"Identifier.type","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"CodeableConcept"}],"condition":["ele-1"],"constraint":[{"key":"ele-1","severity":"error","human":"All FHIR elements must have a @value or children","expression":"hasValue() | (children().count() > id.count())","xpath":"@value|f:*|h:div"}],"isSummary":true,"binding":{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-bindingName","valueString":"IdentifierType"},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-isCommonBinding","valueBoolean":true}],"strength":"extensible","description":"A coded type for an identifier that can be used to determine which identifier to use for a specific purpose.","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/identifier-type"}},"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"n/a"},{"identity":"v2","map":"CE/CNE/CWE"},{"identity":"rim","map":"CD"},{"identity":"orim","map":"fhir:CodeableConcept rdfs:subClassOf dt:CD"},{"identity":"v2","map":"CX.5"},{"identity":"rim","map":"Role.code or implied by context"}]},{"id":"DocumentReference.context.related.identifier.system","path":"DocumentReference.context.related.identifier.system","short":"The namespace for the identifier value","definition":"Establishes the namespace for the value - that is, a URL that describes a set values that are unique.","comment":"see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier","requirements":"There are many sets  of identifiers.
