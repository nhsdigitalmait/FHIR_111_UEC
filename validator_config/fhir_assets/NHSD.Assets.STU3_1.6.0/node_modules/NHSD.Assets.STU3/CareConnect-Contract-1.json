ActConsentType, which generalizes ActDataConsentType; ActFinancialParticipationConsentType; ActInformationAccessCode; AdvanceBeneficiaryNoticeType.  ActPolicyType, which generalizes: ActPrivacyPolicyType, ActSensitivityPrivacyPolicyType, ActSecurityPolicyType.  In the ActClass Code System:  CNTRCT (contract) Description: An agreement of obligation between two or more parties that is subject to contractual law and enforcement, lwhich generalizes FCNTRCT (financial contract) and COV (coverage).  POLICY (policy) - Description: A mandate, regulation, obligation, requirement, rule, or expectation unilaterally imposed by one party on: The activity of another party; the behavior of another party; or the manner in which an act is executed. LEAF CONCEPTS: JURISPOL (jurisdictional policy) Description:A mandate, regulation, obligation, requirement, rule, or expectation unilaterally imposed by a jurisdiction on: The activity of another party; the behavior of another party; or the manner in which an act is executed.Examples:A jurisdictional mandate regarding the prescribing and dispensing of a particular medication. A jurisdictional privacy or security regulation dictating the manner in which personal health information is disclosed. A jurisdictional requirement that certain services or health conditions are reported to a monitoring program, e.g., immunizations, methadone treatment, or cancer registries.ORGPOL (organizational policy)Examples:A clinical or research protocols imposed by a payer, a malpractice insurer, or an institution to which a provider must adhere. A mandate imposed by a denominational institution for a provider to provide or withhold certain information from the patient about treatment options.SCOPOL (scope of practice policy)Description:An ethical or clinical obligation, requirement, rule, or expectation imposed or strongly encouraged by organizations that oversee particular clinical domains or provider certification which define the boundaries within which a provider may practice and which may have legal basis or ramifications.Examples:An ethical obligation for a provider to fully inform a patient about all treatment options. An ethical obligation for a provider not to disclose personal health information that meets certain criteria, e.g., where disclosure might result in harm to the patient or another person. The set of health care services which a provider is credentialed or privileged to provide. STDPOL (standard of practice policy) Examples:A payer may require a prescribing provider to adhere to formulary guidelines. An institution may adopt clinical guidelines and protocols and implement these within its electronic health record and decision support systems.  CONS (consent)Description: The Consent class represents informed consents and all similar medico-legal transactions between the patient (or his legal guardian) and the provider. Examples are informed consent for surgical procedures, informed consent for clinical trials, advanced beneficiary notice, against medical advice decline from service, release of information agreement, etc.  The details of consents vary. Often an institution has a number of different consent forms for various purposes, including reminding the physician about the topics to mention. Such forms also include patient education material. In electronic medical record communication, consents thus are information-generating acts on their own and need to be managed similar to medical activities. Thus, Consent is modeled as a special class of Act. The \"signatures\" to the consent document are represented electronically through Participation instances to the consent object. Typically an informed consent has Participation.typeCode of \"performer\", the healthcare provider informing the patient, and \"consenter\", the patient or legal guardian. Some consent may associate a witness or a notary public (e.g., living wills, advanced directives). In consents where a healthcare provider is not required (e.g. living will), the performer may be the patient himself or a notary public."}]},{"id":"Contract.type.id","path":"Contract.type.id","representation":["xmlAttr"],"short":"xml:id (or equivalent in JSON)","definition":"unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).

NonPerformanceReasonCode Description: The reason the action was not performed, e.g. why the medication was not taken. If an action was not performed, it is often clinically important to know why the action was not taken. RefusalReasonCode Description: Identifies why a request to add (or activate) a record is being refused. Examples include the receiving system not able to match the identifier and find that record in the receiving system, having no permission, or a detected issue exists which precludes the requested action.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rExamples from HL7 ActReason Code System: QUALIMP (quality improvement) Description:Operational activities conducted for the purposes of improving the quality of an activity, product, or service. _PatientProfileQueryReasonCode Description: A collection of concepts identifying why the patient's profile is being queried. _ActInformationManagementReason Description:The rationale or purpose for an act relating to information management, such as archiving information for the purpose of complying with an enterprise data retention policy. _ActInvalidReason (ActInvalidReason) Description: Types of reasons why a substance is invalid for use. _NonPerformanceReasonCode Description: The reason the action wasn't performed, e.g. why the medication was not taken. If an action wasn\"t performed, it is often clinically important to know why the action wasn\"t taken."}]},{"id":"Contract.actionReason.id","path":"Contract.actionReason.id","representation":["xmlAttr"],"short":"xml:id (or equivalent in JSON)","definition":"unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references).
