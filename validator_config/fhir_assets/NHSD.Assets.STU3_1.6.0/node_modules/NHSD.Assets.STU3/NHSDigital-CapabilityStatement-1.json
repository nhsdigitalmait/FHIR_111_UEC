The resource profile is a general statement of what features of the resource are supported overall by the system - the sum total of the facilities it supports. A supported profile is a deeper statement about the functionality of the data and services provided by the server (or used by the client). A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that does? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).  Typically, supported profiles cross resource types to describe a network of related resources, so they are listed here rather than by resource.

A typical case is a laboratory system that produces a set of different reports - this is the list of types of data that it publishes. A key aspect of declaring profiles here is the question of how the client converts knowledge that the server publishes this data into working with the data; the client can inspect individual resources to determine whether they conform to a particular profile, but how does it find the ones that does? It does so by searching using the _profile parameter, so any resources listed here must be valid values for the _profile resource (using the identifier in the target profile).
