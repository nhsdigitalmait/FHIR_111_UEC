For this reason, none of the useful mechanisms described for working with references (e.g. chaining, includes) are possible, nor should servers be expected to be able resolve the reference. Servers may accept an identifier based reference untouched, resolve it, and/or reject it - see CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.referencePolicy. \n\nWhen both an identifier and a literal reference are provided, the literal reference is preferred. Applications processing the resource are allowed - but not required - to check that the identifier matches the literal reference\n\nApplications converting a logical reference to a literal reference may choose to leave the logical reference present, or remove it.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"Reference.identifier","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"Identifier"}],"condition":["ele-1"],"constraint":[{"key":"ele-1","severity":"error","human":"All FHIR elements must have a @value or children","expression":"hasValue() | (children().count() > id.count())","xpath":"@value|f:*|h:div"}],"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"n/a"},{"identity":"v2","map":"CX / EI (occasionally, more often EI maps to a resource id or a URL)"},{"identity":"rim","map":"II - see see identifier pattern at http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Common_Design_Patterns#Identifier_Pattern for relevant discussion.
